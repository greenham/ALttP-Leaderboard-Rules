## Goal: Low%

1. Timing starts on file select and ends upon entering the Triforce room.

2. **Save & Quit is banned. Intentionally dying outside of a dungeon to emulate a Save & Quit is banned. Similarly, console resets (soft and hard) are banned.**

3. You must skip all items and upgrades which are not essential to beat the game.

- **EXCEPTION**: This category uses the OLD ruleset which does NOT require skipping heart container pickups. All other NMG rules apply.
