## Goal: Low%

1. Timing starts on file select and ends upon entering the Triforce room.

2. Save & Quit, including intentionally dying on the overworld to emulate a Save & Quit, is banned.

3. You must skip all items and upgrades which are not essential to beat the game.

- **EXCEPTION**: This category uses the OLD ruleset which does NOT require skipping heart container pickups. All other NMG rules apply.
