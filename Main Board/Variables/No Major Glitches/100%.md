## Goal: 100%

1. Timing starts on file select and ends upon entering the Triforce room.

2. **Save & Quit is banned. Intentionally dying outside of a dungeon to emulate a Save & Quit is banned. Similarly, console resets (soft and hard) are banned.**

3. This requires a full inventory with all maximum level items, 20 hearts and 1/2 magic. Intermediary upgrades and the bomb/arrow upgrades are not required.

**_PLEASE RESET AND SHOW YOUR MENU + 4 BOTTLES AFTER THE CREDITS!_**

This is not a hard requirement, but will greatly assist us in verifying your run, thank you!
