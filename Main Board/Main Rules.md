# ALttP Speedrun Rules & Guidelines

**BE SURE TO READ THE CATEGORY RULES AS WELL!**

Given that this game is popular and has many very optimized times, submissions will be held to high scrutiny, particularly those near the top of the leaderboard. Please be prepared to show additional proof of legitimacy if asked. This may include a recorded history of attempts (if you are not already regularly streaming them), or some other proof that you are capable of playing at the skill level your submission indicates.

The minimum guidelines defined below will, in the vast majority of cases, be enough to ensure legitimacy of your submission, and so we ask that you follow them regardless of your time.

These rules apply to the entire leaderboard, unless otherwise specified by the category's rules.

## GLOBAL RULES

1. Only official Japanese, American and European versions are allowed.

2. Turbo is banned.

3. Pressing Up+Down or Left+Right simultaneously is banned.

4. RAM Preparation is banned. Power cycle or soft reset before your run to prevent this.

5. Video submission is required:

- Video submissions must include one continuous video of your run.
- Do not submit temporary stream VODs. It is highly recommended to submit a YouTube upload, a Twitch highlight, or a Twitch upload.

6. No external tools are allowed to assist the player with physically making inputs during the run, unless there is a valid accessibility reason for doing so.

7. **FOR TIMES IN TOP 20%:**

- Game Audio must be present.
- The full credits must be shown at the end of the run.
- Video submissions must begin with a power cycle or soft reset.
- All gameplay should be featured in video submissions. Continuous sections of missing or obscured gameplay on the order of seconds are likely to be a significant barrier to verification. The moderation team may use discretion in extreme cases of frame drops.

## EMULATOR RULES

1. Allowed emulators are SNES9X (v.1.5 and later) and BSNES (including higan/byuu).

2. Front-ends running a valid SNES9X or BSNES emulator core are allowed (Retroarch, BizHawk, etc.).

3. Emulator or front-end specific functionality is banned (e.g. save states, binding multiple keys, run-ahead, etc).

4. Leaving emulator inputs unbound is allowed. For all emulator inputs that are bound, one-to-one mappings are required with user inputs. An exception is allowed only for diagonal mappings on controllers that require them (e.g. Logitech, etc.).

5. Input must be continually registered for the duration of the button being depressed (e.g. pressing and holding a direction must register as pressing and holding, not just a single frame of input).

6. **FOR TIMES IN TOP 20%:**

- FPS must be displayed for the duration of the run.
- Emulator name/version should be visible or shown at the end of the run.
- The input configuration (button mappings) must be shown at the end of the run.
- Runs on Retroarch and other emulators with the option must show that Run-Ahead was disabled.
