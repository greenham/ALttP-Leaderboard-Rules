# Ruleset: MAJOR GLITCHES

**_BE SURE TO SEE THE CATEGORY-SPECIFIC RULES BELOW THIS LIST!_**

This category is meant to be very unrestrictive to allow use of _most_ glitches. However, a few things which are extremely powerful are banned, so as not to remove too much actual gameplay from speedruns.

The following techniques are **BANNED** in MG categories:

- Arbitrary Code Execution
  - Causing the game to execute values from memory as code/instructions.
- Arbitrary Memory Writes
  - Out of Bounds Misslotting:
    - Misslotting an ancilla to any "slot" higher than 9, or less than 0 (not currently possible)
    - Any ancilla created must have its ID written to an address between $7E0C4A and $7E0C53, inclusive.
  - EG2 Out of Bounds Writes
    - Transferring room data to room IDs on the secondary underworld map (EG2), besides those belonging to properly defined rooms
    - Specifically, having your room ID become any value in the range $128 and $1FF, inclusive, by any means, is banned.
